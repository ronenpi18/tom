#AppFog Command Line Interface Utility

**AF** is a cli for the AppFog PaaS. The goal of this node module is to port the af gem to node land 
so thatyou can interact with AppFog on OSX machine with only node installed. Also that you can interact with the AppFog
API from node programs.

The command utility wraps the functionality of appfog-api with pretty console output

#Usage
`npm install -g af`

#Dev Roadmap

###To Do:
- add coloured outputs
- prettier tables etc

###Possible future features
- apps & stats on login
- idiot proofing inputs E.G `af <app-name> stats` will work the same as `af stats <app-name>`
- auto deploy github post recieve app to your instance of appfog
